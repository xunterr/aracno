Aracno is a web-scale, distributed, polite web crawler. It utilizes a fully distributed peer-to-peer protocol to scale across millions of hosts and thousands of operations per second.

## Why?
There are many web crawlers out there, but most either don't support distributed mode or require a massive infrastructure to function. Aracno is simple. Thereâ€™s nothing extra you need to set up to enable distributed mode!

## Quickstart
In order to run Aracno you need:
1. Install rocksdb - [Rocksdb installation guide](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/blob/main/INSTALL.md) (just `make static_lib` and `sudo make install`)
2. Build: `go build`
3. Run: `./aracno`
